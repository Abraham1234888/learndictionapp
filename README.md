Final Project 
🗣️ Learndiction: Master the Global Rhythm of English

🌟 The Story in a Nutshell

Learndiction is more than just a pronunciation tool—it's a bridge to global confidence.

Non-native English speakers often face a hidden challenge: knowing the words, but struggling with the subtle rhythms, intonations, and stress patterns that make communication fluent and clear. Our app solves this by moving beyond simple phonetics, offering a unique, region-specific approach to diction mastery.

We recognize that the way English is spoken in Africa (e.g., Nigerian or South African English) is distinct from Asia (e.g., Indian or Filipino English), or even North America and Europe. Learndiction provides tailored modules that help users tune their speech to the internationally accepted Standard English (General American or Received Pronunciation) or choose a specific regional accent for professional or social needs.

Our goal: To eliminate the friction of miscommunication and empower every user to speak English with clarity, confidence, and the right diction, regardless of their native language background.

✨ Features That Build Confidence

Learndiction offers a suite of powerful tools designed for practical, real-world improvement:

1. Global Accent Modules

Targeted training grouped by regions to address common diction challenges specific to Africa, Asia, North America, and other major linguistic groups. Users can select a module relevant to their native language.

2. Real-Time Speech Analysis

Using advanced audio processing, the app analyzes user speech for:

Word Stress: Highlighting syllables that were improperly stressed.

Intonation: Providing visual feedback on sentence pitch and rhythm.

Vowel and Consonant Clarity: Pinpointing specific sounds that need adjustment.

3. Interactive Diction Labs

Practice key phrases, business jargon, and everyday conversation in a simulated environment. Users are given instant feedback on their rhythm and clarity.

4. Vocabulary in Context

Learn new words accompanied by audio examples demonstrating correct stress and intonation patterns, ensuring words are learned in their full phonetic context, not just their spelling.

5. Progress Tracking & Challenges

Monitor improvement over time, complete weekly diction challenges, and earn badges for mastering complex speech patterns.
